## General Information
- The Project is to find the Variables which has high influence for demand on Boom bikes.
- We have used Linear regression algorithm to solve this problem.
- we have used day.csv file which has the data Provided by company.
- Readme.txt file given more details about the Variables Values.

## Conclusions
- Temp,summer season,Sept month are the top three features which explains the demand for bikes
